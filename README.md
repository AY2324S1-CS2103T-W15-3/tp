ClubMembersContacts is an app to help EXCO members of School of Computing's CCAs to manage the contacts of all their members and applicants in a fast and convenient yet powerful way through a CLI or text-based interface for greater speed.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
