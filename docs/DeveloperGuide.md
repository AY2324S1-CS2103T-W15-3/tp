### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delm 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MemberListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Member`, `Applicant` and `Tag` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API**: [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delm 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteMemberCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteMemberCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteMemberCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a member).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddMemberCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddMemberCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddMemberCommandParser`, `DeleteMemberCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API**: [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="488" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., objects that extend from the abstract `Person` class (which are contained in a generic `UniquePersonList` object) and an `ObservableList<Tag>`.
* stores an updatable `ObservableList<Task>` of `Task` objects that update based on which `Member` is selected with the `viewtasks` command.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Member` and `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<? extends Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain; they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<img src="images/ModelPersonClassDiagram.png" width="342" />

The `Member` and `Applicant` classes both extend from the abstract `Person` class, and each of these classes have the
associated fields specific to them.

### Storage component

**API**: [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add `Member`/`Applicant` feature


The `addMember` and `addApplicant` command is used to add a member or an applicant to the address book.
The commands are implemented in the `AddMemberCommand` and `AddApplicantCommand` class, which extends the `Command`
class.

The add mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager` which parses the command input from the user to determine the
appropriate
command to execute. The execute function checks whether the `Member`/`Applicant` is present in the `AddressBook`.
The `Member`/`Applicant` is added into the `AddressBook` if it is not present. Otherwise, an error message is returned.

<img src="images/AddApplicantActivityDiagram.png">

The diagram above describes the behaviour of adding an applicant to the `AddressBook`. When the user enters the command,
the command is parsed to determine whether it is a valid command. If it is valid, the `Applicant` is added into the 
`AddressBook` and a success message is shown, else, an error message is shown.

### View all `Member`/`Applicant` feature

Lists all members/applicants in the address book to the user. For example, if the previous list was filtered (say by `FindMemberCommand` or `FindApplicantCommand`),
then set it to unfiltered again.

1. The `ViewMembersCommand` or `ViewApplicantsCommand` object's execute() method is called. 
2. This updates the model via its `updateFilteredMemberList()` or `updateFilteredApplicantList()` method which is called with its predicate as always returning true. 
3. All members/applicants in the address book are shown to the user in the members/applicants list.

### Delete an applicant

The applicant at the specific `applicantIndex` in the applicant list will be deleted. Compulsory fields for the
`DeleteApplicantCommand` include: `applicantIndex`. An example of how this feature can be used is as follows:

* Step 1. The `DeleteApplicantCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The `applicantIndex` is checked to be within the valid range of the applicant list. If the `applicantIndex`
  given
  is invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3. The applicant at the given `applicantIndex` is referenced.
* Step 4. The model object's `deleteApplicant()` method is called. The input parameter is the referenced applicant.
* Step 5. The applicant is deleted from the applicant list.

### Delete a member

The member at the specific memberIndex in the member list will be deleted. Compulsory fields for
the `DeleteMemberCommand`
include: `memberIndex`. An example of how this feature can be used is as follows:

* Step 1. The `DeleteMemberCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The `memberIndex` is checked to be within the valid range of the member list. If the `memberIndex` given is
  invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3. The member at the given `memberIndex` is referenced.
* Step 4. The model object's `deleteMember()` method is called. The input parameter is the referenced member.
* Step 5. The member is deleted from the member list.

### Delete an applicant

The applicant at the specific `applicantIndex` in the applicant list will be deleted. Compulsory fields for the
`DeleteApplicantCommand` include: `applicantIndex`. An example of how this feature can be used is as follows:

* Step 1. The `DeleteApplicantCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The `applicantIndex` is checked to be within the valid range of the applicant list. If the `applicantIndex`
  given
  is invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3. The applicant at the given `applicantIndex` is referenced.
* Step 4. The model object's `deleteApplicant()` method is called. The input parameter is the referenced applicant.
* Step 5. The applicant is deleted from the applicant list.

### Find an applicant

All applicants that contains any field with the specified keyword will be listed. Compulsory fields for the
`FindApplicantCommand` include: `keyword`. An example of how this feature can be used is as follows:

* Step 1. The `FindApplicantCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The model object's `updateFilteredApplicantList()` is called, with the keyword as the predicate.
* Step 3. The applicant list is filtered to only reflect applicants with fields (name, phone number) that contain the
  keyword.
* Step 4. The filtered member list is shown.

### Find a member

All members that contains any field with the specified keyword will be listed. Compulsory fields for
`FindApplicantCommand` include: `keyword`. An example of how this feature can be used is as follows:

* Step 1. The `FindMemberCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2. The model object's `updateFilteredMemberList()` is called, with the keyword as the predicate.
* Step 3. The member list is filtered to only reflect members with fields (name, email, phone number, telegram handle,
  tag) that contain the keyword.
* Step 4. The filtered member list is shown.

### Edit a member

Edits the details of an existing member identified by their index number in the displayed member list. Existing values
will be overwritten by the input values.

* Step 1: The `EditMemberCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2: The member index is checked to be within the valid range of the member list. If the member index given is
  invalid (e.g., out of range), a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3: The member at the given index is referenced based on the provided member index.
* Step 4: The `EditMemberCommand` calls the model object's `setMember()` method. It updates the member with the new
  details
  provided, effectively modifying the existing member's information.
* Step 5: After the execution of the `EditMemberCommand`, the member's details are successfully edited in the member
  list.

### Edit an applicant

Edits the details of an existing applicant identified by their index number in the displayed applicant list. Existing
values will be overwritten by the input values.

* Step 1: The `EditApplicantCommand` object's `execute()` method is called.
* Step 2: The applicant index is checked to be within the valid range of the applicant list. If the applicant index
  given is invalid (e.g., out of range), a `CommandException` is thrown.
* Step 3: The applicant at the given index is referenced based on the provided applicant index.
* Step 4: The `EditApplicantCommand` calls the model object's `setApplicant()` method. It updates the member with the
  new
  details provided, effectively modifying the existing applicant's information.
* Step 5: After the execution of the `EditApplicantCommand`, the applicant's details are successfully edited in the
  applicant list.

### Copy a `Member`/`Applicant`

Copies the details of an existing `Member`/`Applicant` identified by their index number in the displayed member/applicant list into the
clipboard. The commands are implemented in the `CopyMemberCommand` and `CopyApplicantCommand` classes, which extend the `Command` class.

1. The `CopyMemberCommand`/`CopyApplicantCommand` object's execute() method is called.
2. The `Member`/`Applicant` index is checked to be within the valid range of the member list. If the index given is invalid (e.g., out of range), a `CommandException` is thrown.
3. The `Member`/`Applicant` at the given index is referenced based on the provided member index.
4. The `CopyMemberCommand`/`CopyApplicantCommand` calls the copies the details given by the `Member#detailsToCopy`/`Applicant#detailsToCopy` method into the clipboard.

The diagram below describes this behaviour concisely. It shows how a user's command is processed and what message is ultimately shown if they decide, for example, to copy a member's details.

<img src="images/CopyMemberActivityDiagram.png">

### View all available tags

The view tags mechanism lists all available tags in the address book that a user can use to tag a member.
All available tags in the address book are shown to the user in the tags list.
When a new member is added, deleted or edited, the `updateTags` method is called to update the list of available tags.

<img src="images/ViewTagsSequenceDiagram.png" width="543" alt="ViewTagsSequenceDiagram"/>

In the above diagram, when the `DeleteMemberCommand::execute` method is called,`Member` is deleted from 
the `ModelManager` using the `deleteMember()` method, which then updates the `tags` in `AddressBook` using 
the `updateTags()` method.

`tags` is an `ObservableList` which will update the `TagsListPanel` UI component when there is a change in the `tags`
list.

### \[Proposed\] Allocating tasks to Members

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed allocating tasks to `Member` objects is implemented using either `ToDo` or `Deadline` or `Events` object.
They extend from the `Tasks` class. A `Tasklist` object will be instantiated for each `Member` object, used to store the
list of tasks assigned to each individual. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `ToDo#markAsDone()`â€” Will be used to mark the todo of each Member as done
* `ToDo#markAsUnDone()`â€” Will be used to mark the todo of each Member as undone
* `Deadline#markAsDone()`â€” Will be used to mark the deadline of each Member as done
* `Deadline#markAsUnDone()`â€” Will be used to mark the deadline of each Member as done
* `Event#markAsDone()`â€” Will be used to mark the deadline of each Member as done
* `Event#markAsUnDone()`â€” Will be used to mark the deadline of each Member as done

These operations are exposed in the `Task` parent class as `Task#markAsDone()` and `Task#markAsUnDone()` to execute the
above-mentioned operations.

Step 1: The user adds a new `Member` using the `addMember` command. At this point, a `TaskList` instance will be
assigned to that member.

Step 2: When the user uses the `addToDo` command, a `ToDo` object containing the details parsed in through the code will
be stored and under the user identified by their telegram handle, which is passed as a parameter. It namely stores the
`Tasks.taskName`.

Step 3: When the user uses the `addDeadline` command, a `Deadline` object containing the details parsed in through the
code will
be stored and under the user identified by their telegram handle, which is passed as a parameter. It namely stores the
`Tasks.taskName`, `Deadline.dueDate` and `Deadline.dueTime`.

Step 4: When the user uses the `addEvent` command, an `Event` object containing the details parsed in through the code
will
be stored and under the user identified by their telegram handle, which is passed as a parameter. It namely stores the
`Tasks.taskName`, `Event.startDate`, `Deadline.startTime`, `Event.endDate` and `Deadline.endTime`.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delm 5` command to delete the 5th member in the address book. The `DeleteMemberCommand`
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delm 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `adda /name David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `addm` command also
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into
the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delm`, just save the member being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
