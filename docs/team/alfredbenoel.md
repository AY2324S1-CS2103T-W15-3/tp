### Project: ClubMembersContacts

ClubMembersContacts is an application that allows users to keep track of their club members' contact information.

Below is a summary of my contributions to the project.

* [Code Contributed](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=alfredbenoel&breakdown=false&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2023-09-22&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos)
* Enhancements Implemented:

  * Added Member Class
    * Created classes to parse command arguments and create a new member object
    * Created new classes to store member information (i.e. Telegram)
    * Updated existing classes to store member information
    * Ensured existing automated tests covered the new commands

  * Added the copy member and applicant features
    * Allows users to copy a member or applicant's information to the clipboard for easy pasting elsewhere
    * Created classes including `CopyMemberCommand`, `CopyMemberCommandParser`, etc.
    * Added new tests for the new commands and ensured existing automated tests (such as for `AddressBookParser`)
      covered the new commands
  * Updated the UI
    * To match our app concept of splitting the member and applicant features, added the separate `Member`
      and `Applicant` columns to the UI
    * Among other UI enhancements, made the command result box wrap text to make it easier for users to read
  * Added command aliases for every command (such as `addm` for `addMember`) to make it easier for users to use the
    app
  * Made commands case-insensitive to make it easier for users to type them
* Contributions to the UG:
  * Wrote the section on viewing all member(s)/applicant(s)
  * Wrote the section on copying a member and copying an applicant
  * Improved the formatting of the UG
    * Increased the width of the page so that the code snippets are not cut off
    * Adjusted the size of images so that they are not too big and flowed better with the document
    * Added callout boxes to highlight important information
* Contributions to the DG:
  * to be added soon
* Contributions to team-based tasks:
